# PTZ-Control-qt

A (hopefully) cross-platform app to control and extend the functionality of (currently only) Panasonic PTZ Cameras over HTTP.

## Requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

`[python] ./main.py [Camera IP/Hostname]`

Currently, cameras can only be opened on startup. The Open Camera Button is there, but it doesn't work
